# React Respuestas Segun lo Trabajado
### Handling State
* State in React controls a component's behavior and rendering.
* State changes trigger re-renders.
* `useState` (in functional components) is key for managing state.
* For complex or shared state, Context API or libraries like Redux are options.

### Programming Logic
* Logic is written in JavaScript within components.
* Includes functions, control flow, and event logic.
* Event handlers are crucial for interactivity.

### Conditional Rendering
* Allows displaying different elements based on conditions.
* Uses `if/else`, ternary operator (`? :`), or `&&`.
* Essential for dynamic UIs.

### Rendering Lists
* Uses `map()` on arrays to render lists.
* Each item must have a unique `key` prop for React's efficiency.
* Keys cannot be a number !!!

### Events
* React uses a consistent synthetic event system.
* Event handlers are functions passed as props (e.g., `onClick`).
* Event names are camelCase.

### Saving to LocalStorage
* `localStorage` persistently stores data in the browser.
* Use `localStorage.setItem('key', 'value')` to save and `localStorage.getItem('key')` to read.
* Useful for preferences, tokens, etc.
